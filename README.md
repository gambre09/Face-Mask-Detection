# Discrption
The Face Mask Detection project includes Python programming, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), MobileNetV2, and advanced image processing technique to create a robust and efficient detecting of presence of face masks in real-time.

# Features
- Real-Time Detection: The system is designed to detect face masks in real-time, making it suitable for various applications, such as monitoring public spaces, workplaces, or any environment where adherence to face mask protocols is crucial.
- OpenCV Integration: OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, is employed to capture and process video frames. The project harnesses the capabilities of OpenCV to handle image and video input, enabling seamless integration with the face mask detection algorithm.
- MobileNetV2 Architecture: The deep learning model is built using the MobileNetV2 architecture, a lightweight yet highly efficient neural network designed for mobile and edge devices. This ensures that the face mask detection process is fast and can be deployed on resource-constrained devices.
- Image Processing Techniques: Advanced image processing techniques are employed to preprocess the input frames, enhancing the accuracy of face mask detection. These techniques may include color space manipulation, image resizing, and normalization to optimize the model's performance.
